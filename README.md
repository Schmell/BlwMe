# BlwTest
Usage: <br/>
First open the localManager.html and select the one 1 of the WedSummer---.blw files from the repos blw folder (the others dont always work)
<br/>
Then goto Racing.html and that should populte the indexedDB (you may have to refresh)
<br/>
Then select a race to begin editing (Dark colored are races that have been sailed). I recommend using Race 3 to start
<br/>
The idea is that you cue multiple competitors aand then use the finish button to add time
<br/><br/>
Currently:
<br/>
Elapsed time is not calculaating correctly because we have no date or timestanmp to calculate with
<br/>
Also there is a problem when using the adjustment buttons when you have insterted a code
